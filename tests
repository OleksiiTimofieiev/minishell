2) If the user deletes one of necessary variables(such as PWD, OLDPWD, HOME, etc) it must be 
restored, or an appropriate message must be printed. Sure there must be no segfaults if we 
are executing echo $PWD ; unsetenv PWD ; echo $PWD ; cd ../ or echo $OLDPWD ; unsetenv OLDPWD ; 
echo $OLDPWD ; cd - or echo $HOME ; unsetenv HOME ; echo $HOME ; cd

4) The shell must take into account PS2 variable. echo \ 1 - !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

5) The shell must understand \ in input sequence. It must read second line if the 
user enters echo 1 2 3\4 and the result will be: 1 2 34.

6) The shell must handle 3 types of quotes: single, double and command quotes with
appropriate changes for every type(nothing is changed in single quotes, several thing
are changed in double quotes and everything is changed without quotes.) Pay great attention 
to this point, as many test can be created to test it, and it is not so easy to handle.

7) The shell must print which quotes are missing if the user types something with wring 
number of quotes. echo "123'rrr must result in double quote-> or dquote.

9) The shell must manage access rights for PATH variable. So if I type mkdir exe ;
cp /bin/ls exe/. ; chmod 0 exe ; setenv PATH $PWD/exe and try to execute ls -l 
it must fail(without message of access denied).
