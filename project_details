Project ideas:
• The executable are those you can find in the paths indicated in the PATH variable.
• In cases where the executable cannot be found, it has to show an error message and display the prompt again.
- echo = +, cd = +, setenv, unsetenv, env = +, exit = +
- You must manage expansions $ and  ̃

Bonus:
- Management of signals and in particular Ctrl-C. The use of global variables is allowed as part of this bonus.
- Management of execution rights in the PATH.
- The separation of commands with ";".
- Other bonuses that you will think to be useful.
